             MY DATABASE SETUP

    * I created a database named "to-do"

    * I created two tables which are 
        1. "users_info"
        2. "users_tasks"
    
    * In the users_info table i created eight rows (all in lower case) which are:
        1. "id" (The id has an auto-increment with a primary key)
        2. "full_name"
        3. "email"
        4. "username"
        5. "hashed_password"
        6. "profile"
        7. "bio"
        8. "country" 

    * In the users_tasks table i created seven rows (all in lower case except "SN") which are:
        1. "id" (The id has an auto-increment with a primary key)
        2. "SN"
        3. "title"
        4. "date"
        5. "category"
        6. "notes"
        7. "task"

        Thats all about the DATABASE SETUP.
